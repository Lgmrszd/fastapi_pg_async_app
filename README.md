# FastAPI + SQLALchemy + asyncpg test app

This is a simple asynchronous FastAPI application that uses SQLAlchemy ORM for data handling
and implements basic CRUD endpoints

Database calls are generated by SQLAlchemy 2.0 and handled by asyncpg

This app also includes unit tests for crud module, using Pytest library and AnyIO pytest module for async support
(installed as part of FastAPI) and testcontainers module for setting up temporary database container.
